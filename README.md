# Getting started with Dapr

This repository provides a starting point for engineering teams to get started with
Dapr (Distributed runtime). A CNCF project sponsored by Microsoft which aims 
to take the pain out of developing modern distributed Microservices by handling
a lot of the cross cutting concerns.


# Dapr architecture

Dapr is a language agnostic runtime that allows you to build Cloud native 
distributed applications. 

In simple terms it takes away lot of the toil around common cross cutting 
concerns that developers have to think about when developing applications
based on Microservices architecture. Key concerns addresssed by Dapr include:

* State management
* Pub/sub
* Secrets management
* Service discovery
