# Getting started with Dapr

This repository provides a starting point for engineering teams to get started with
Dapr (Distributed runtime). A CNCF project sponsored by Microsoft which aims 
to take the pain out of developing modern distributed Microservices by handling
a lot of the cross cutting concerns.


# Dapr architecture

distributed applications.
