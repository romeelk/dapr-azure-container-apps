# Getting started with state block

In this example we are going to use dotnet 6.0
to create a simple program demonstrating the Dapr state building block.

## Create the project

First we create a dotnet console project:

```
dotnet new console --name dapr-state
```

We then import the Dapr-Client package

```
dotnet add package Dapr.Client
```
